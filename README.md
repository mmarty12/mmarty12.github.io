Personal website for IAT814 Visualization and Visual Analytics course.

---
This is a personal website to store the created visualization during the IAT814 course (Spring 2026).
'Home' page contains my contact information, affiliation, education records, courses and research experience, and acquired  skills.
The 'Visualization Portfolio' page (which can be accessed through the button on the sidebar) contains two custom svg visualizations: 
  - 'Step Count' bar chart that displays my step count data (retrieved from personal phone inbuilt application) for the 20day period (Jan 12 - Jan 31);
  - 'My "Ring-bearer Journey" Progress' svg art that speculates how far would I go if I were to travel through Tolkien's Middle-earth (sorry, I'm a fan :D);

To return to the 'Home' page, please click on the corresponding icon at the bottom of the sidebar.

The initial template for the website was implemented with the help of Github Copilot; all "filling" was done myself.

Also, I consulted external sources (svg tutorials, ChatGPT v5.2) for creating svg images, as I have little experience in this field. The output of LLM was deeply analysed and adjusted myself.
